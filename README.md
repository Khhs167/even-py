# even-py
A number of different is-even calculations for python  

[![Tests](https://github.com/Khhs167/even-py/actions/workflows/testing.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Khhs167/even-py/actions/workflows/testing.yml)

# API Specification
The file should define a function called is_even. That function should take in a single number, and return a string.
This string should be "even" if the number is even, and "odd" if the number is odd

The number can be any number between 0 and 10,000 but the implementation SHOULD support numbers larger than that if possible.

# File Structure
```py
# file_name.py by author

# Some sort of description, it should try follow the 80 character limit.
# It can be multiple lines, but should NEVER break after punctuation
# unless said punctuation is for lists.

# New paragraphs can be specified like this. Remember than if anything
# is unclear:
# - Look through this example
# - Check issues
# - Check other files

# This program is under the GNU General Public License, aka the GPL

The files should follow the structure shown, and use snake_case for all naming(including file naming). The GPL line should be kept as-is  
It is also reccomended to try to compress the actual code as much, preferrably on as few lines as possible to make it easier for people
who have a difficulity scrolling vertically.
